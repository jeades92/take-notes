<h1>Small Business Note Taker</h1>
<p>This is a note-taking application that allows small business owners to organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks they need to complete. Users can create, save, and view notes with ease. The application presents a landing page with a link to a notes page, where existing notes are listed in the left-hand column, and empty fields are provided to enter a new note title and text in the right-hand column. Once saved, the new note appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.</p>
